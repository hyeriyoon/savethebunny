<h1>Game Plan</h1>
<p>The attached game templates are a starting point, but how you use your acquired JavaScript skills in building your game is up to you.</p>
<p>Having a game plan is <strong>MANDATORY</strong>, it will account for 10% of your final grade.</p>
<p>In essence, your game plan acts as both a blueprint of <strong>what</strong> you will build as well as a a breakdown of the elements that you'll build it with.</p>
<p>A successful Game Plan should include, at minimum:</p>
<ol>
<li>A text description of game design and high level game functionality</li>
<li>A screen-by-screen description of the UI
<ol>
<li>Identify as many HTML elements as possible&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A breakdown of the functional requirements
<ul>
<li>See provided game templates&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A description chart of primary game loop(s) and/or logic flow<br>
<ul>
<li>What happens each turn if turn based or each loop if time driven?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Glossary of Variables
<ol>
<li>name</li>
<li>description</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Glossary of Functions
<ol>
<li>name</li>
<li>description</li>
<li>parameters</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Glossary of Objects
<ol>
<li>Properties</li>
<li>Methods</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Though you <strong>must submit your game plan before Day 06 (June 17)</strong>, its primary purpose is to guide you from concept development through to completion of your project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is intended to be a living document that evolves as you proceed through your build.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although you will be expected to meet the high-level functional requirements that you define in your game plan, everything else about it is fluid and your own.</p>
